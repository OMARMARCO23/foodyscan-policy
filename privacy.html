        <h1>Privacy Policy for FoodyScan</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> July 30, 2024</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to FoodyScan ("we," "our," or "us"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our FoodyScan mobile application (the "Application"). Please read this privacy policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this privacy policy, please do not access the application.</p>

        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect information that you provide to us directly when you use the Application. All data is processed and stored locally on your device.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Scan Data:</strong> We collect images of food labels that you scan using the Application's camera or gallery function.</li>
            <li><strong>Dietary Profile:</strong> We collect the dietary preferences and restrictions (e.g., "vegan," "gluten-free," "allergic to nuts") that you voluntarily provide to tailor the analysis.</li>
            <li><strong>Application Settings:</strong> We store your chosen language preference and other settings locally on your device.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>All scan history, images, and settings are stored exclusively on your device. They are not uploaded to our servers.</strong></p>

        <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>The information you provide is used solely to deliver the core functionality of the Application:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To analyze food label images and provide health insights.</li>
            <li>To personalize the analysis based on your dietary profile.</li>
            <li>To store your scan history for your personal reference on your device.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The images and dietary information you provide are sent securely to a third-party AI service (Google Gemini) to perform the analysis. We do not store this information on any server after the analysis is complete. The results are returned directly to your device and stored locally.</p>

        <h2>4. Third-Party Services (Google Gemini)</h2>
        <p>To provide the AI-powered analysis, we use the Google Gemini API. When you scan a product, the image and your dietary profile are sent to Google for processing. We do not share any other personal information with Google. Google's use of this data is governed by their own privacy policy and terms of service. We encourage you to review them.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Privacy Policy</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Data Security and Retention</h2>
        <p>We take the security of your data seriously. All data transmitted to the Google Gemini API is encrypted in transit (using HTTPS). As all scan results and user-provided data are stored locally on your device, you have full control over it. Data is retained on your device until you choose to delete it (either by clearing your history within the app or by uninstalling the Application).</p>

        <h2>6. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
        <p>Because your data is stored on your device, you have direct control:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Access and Correction:</strong> You can review and modify your dietary profile at any time in the Application's settings.</li>
            <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> You can delete individual scan records or your entire scan history from within the Application. Uninstalling the Application will also remove all its stored data from your device.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Childrenâ€™s Privacy</h2>
        <p>The Application is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received information from a user under the age of 13, we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible.</p>

        <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Effective Date" at the top. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>

        <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at:</p>
